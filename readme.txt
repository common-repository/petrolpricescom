Add the current maximum, minimum and average UK fuel prices to your blog posts or sidebar.

== Description ==

Using the data feeds provided by PetrolPrices.com, the UK's most accurate fuel price tracking service, this
plugin provides both a widget and shortcode allowing you to add the current minimum, maximum and average
fuel price data for anywhere in the UK your blog.

== Installation ==

Once the plugin is activated in the plugin control panel you can use the widget admin to add it to your
widgetized theme and configure the search parameters, or use the shortcode `petrolprices` to include
the data in a page or post.

The shortcode can take the same two arguments as the widget -- type and value -- specifying the search
information. Type should be one of postcode, town or county while value should be the area to display
data for, for example 'GU12' or 'Aldershot'. More information is available on the
[PetrolPrices.com feeds page](http://www.petrolprices.com/feeds/#wordpress).

The look of the display table can be customised through the use of CSS. The table is generated with an
ID of `petrolprices_averages`.
